# DeezLoadr
> A deezer music downloader.

DeezLoadr is a program for downloading music from Deezer music streaming service.
It is intended for educational and private use only, and **not** as a tool for pirating and distributing music :exclamation:
Remember that the artists and studios put a lot of work into making music - purchase music to support them :muscle:

Since I am also caught up with other things I can't work on this very often.
Right now it is just a basic tool which I hope will be improved in the future, and be contributed to :sunglasses:
